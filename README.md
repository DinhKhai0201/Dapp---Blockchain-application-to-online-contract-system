# Dapp---Blockchain-application-to-online-contract-system
Decentralized applications on the blockchain are increasingly used widely thanks to confidentiality and cannot change data. Applying Block chain to the online real estate contract system is an increasingly new trend and is proposed to be widely applied. The application helps increase transparency by the signature data being public, helping those participating in the system can identify the information of the signer. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, all stored information needs to be verified by the large number of communities participating in the Ethereum network. For the convenience of users, the application is deployed as a web application, transactions are carried out on a friendly interface linking an intermediary server to create synchronized data sockets. combined access to data from smart contracts - where the database is distribut<br />
