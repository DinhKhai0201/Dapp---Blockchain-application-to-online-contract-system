              <h2>Hello from an ES6 Class Component</h2>
              <p>If you’re working on a team that already understands classes, then ES6 classes are clearly easier to understand than the alternatives mentioned above. They look, feel, and operate similar to the C# and Java classes so many enterprise developers have already embraced (yes, for better or worse).</p>
              <p>Classes make it simple to declare static functions via a single keyword. There’s no need to learn a pattern.</p>
              <h3>A Bright, Standardized Future</h3>
              <p>Yes, classes put developers in an object-oriented mindset which masks the true power of JavaScript, but I look forward to a future where JavaScript code bases aren’t composed of so many different styles. ES6 classes finally give us a clear, consistent, standardized pattern to follow. Clean code is about writing code for humans, so I favor the patterns that best convey my intent. While there are certainly risks of misuse, ES6 classes provide a practical, clear path for creating JavaScript applications in a consistent style.</p>
